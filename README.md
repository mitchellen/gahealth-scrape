* Code is super ugly while I get things working(and probably after)


Scrape the Javascript heavy version of the Georgia Health Inspection website. The old site was obviosuly straight HTML because all other versions of this I could find were using BeautifulSoup. This version is using Selenium and requires the Chrome WebDriver. I will look into why I was having issues with Geckodrive and Firefox, but the scrolling just wasn't working. The scroll in Chrome is still weird and will not let you run headless.
